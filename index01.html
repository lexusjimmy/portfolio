                As personal drones become more popular, we can envision a future where flying selfie bots are always with us. At present, users have to be very skillful to pilot the drone and are not easy to take aerial selfies by state-of-the-art methods. Based on user observation, we generalize the interaction flow of selfie taking into two stages: Positioning and Framing stage. In each stage, we present new interaction techniques including a direct pointing technique, two fine-tuning techniques, and a touch manipulation for framing. We conducted an experiment in VR and found that positioning a camera by using our Cylindrical and Spherical techniques are more efficient and easier to learn and use. We implemented a proof-of-concept Skyfie controller for evaluation. The result shows users felt intuitive and expressed enthusiasm to take aerial selfies with our techniques. Finally, we discuss the insights from the evaluation and conclude with future directions.

                EasyAuction is a website that allows people to upload their items for sold. Visitors can log-in with facebook account and leave messages to sellers. A basic and easy website for second-hand goods selling.<br>
                  Since this website is powered by Google firebase, it updates the messages immediately. You can even regard it as a messenger. <br>
                  Although it has database to save the data that users upload, I didn't use any of the backend technology. Simply using the Jquery and JavaScript accomplish it.

                It is not the real official site of department of Digital Contents and Technology. In fact, it's a website for practicing "responsive design".<br>
                  In this website, I designed 5 kinds of layout to present the same contents. Layout changes automatically depend on window size to improve its readibility. <br>
                  The CSS file is produced by SASS, which make it easier to read.

                This is the official website of my Graduation Exhibition. During that period of time, it was quite popular to make website with parallax, so we also decided to make a website with parallax. <br>
                  I tried to make a parallax website simply with JavaScript and Jquery but in vain, so I used ScrollMagic, which is a famous framework known for making parallax to accomplish my goal.

                BBR, which is standed for "Better Badminton Revolution" is an original training tool for badminton. We found out the problem of lacking badminton practicing place, while this sports require highly technique. <br>
                  We invented this system to help people practice the steps of badminton. Inspired by the video game "Dance Dance Revolution", we designing our tool to let user practice while playing our tool. User can use it without going to badminton field.<br>
                  With these innovation, this tool won "金驗獎". <br>
                  This system consist three hypersonic distance detector and one android phone. Using the node- js we can read the result from detector and conduct the game.
